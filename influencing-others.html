            <h3>INFLUENCING OTHERS</h3> 
        </div>
        <div style="line-height:20px">
            <p> </p>
            <p>Influence is not innate, it is acquired. Having an impact in a person's life or career requires special skills insofar as this influence could be judged positive or negative. It is in this sense that Walt Disney expresses himself when he says: there are three kinds of people in the world: first, the real poisoners who discourage others, trample their creativity and tell them what they cannot make. Second, the individualists. They mean well, but only think of themselves. They look after their own interests without ever helping others. And finally, the hubcaps of lives. They intervene to enrich the lives of others. They take them to a higher level and inspire them.</p>
            <p>The influence that you should have falls under the third category of person, that is to say, to take care of others in order to motivate them in their personal choice. To do so, here are the steps you should take into account in order to achieve this.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Be a model of integrity: </p>
            <p>Integrity is the essential quality to influence others, it is based on respect, dignity and trust. If any of these qualities are missing or corrupted, your integrity remains open to question. The sense of integrity for a person who wishes to have influence over others comes down to commitment, to putting morality before personal profile, service before power, principle before facility, community before the person. Integrity remains an internal and continuous work.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Caring for and having faith in others: </p>
            <p>Being able to influence people's lives starts with caring for and having faith in them. By taking a good look around you, you will discover people who need encouragement, recognition, security and hope. Show attention to others, give them consideration, love, respect, in short, encourage them. Influence is intimately linked to encouragement. Most people don't believe in them, the value you give them is almost identical to the value they have of themselves, which directly allows you to live up to the trust you have in them, them.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Promoting the development of others: </p>
            <p>Helping others to develop their potential and to realize themselves goes through exploiting their passion, all individuals, from the calmest to the least demonstrative, are passionate about something, you just have to observe and find.</p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">Generate other influencers:</p>
            <p> Whenever you influence people who do not or cannot influence others, you limit your own influences in this sense, you will have to deal with their weak point, concentrate on their strengths, their give resources, instill in them the value of personal development, namely attitude, the quality of relationships and leadership. Indeed, generating leaders extends your sphere of influence, increases the potential of new leaders and ensures a better future for the organization.
                The influence you should have on others directly gives you the title of a mentor. Allowing others to discover the best version of themselves is participating in a rich world, a prosperous organization and a fulfilled life.</p>
