            <h3>DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION IN THE WORKPLACE </h3> 
        </div>
        <div style="line-height:20px">
            <p> </p>
            <p>Diversity and inclusion is an important element of a progressive institution. In recent times, efforts have been made by both governmental and non-governmental institutions to enhance diversity of opinions people and to also include members of a marginalized group.</p>
            <i>Diversity and inclusion are two interconnected concepts—but they are far from interchangeable. Diversity is about representation or the make-up of an entity. Inclusion is about how well the contributions, presence, and perspectives of different groups of people are valued and integrated into an environment.” 
                — Matt Bush, Culture Coaching Lead at Great place to work </i>

            <p>Diversity and inclusion are two interconnected concepts—but they are far from interchangeable. Diversity is about representation or the make-up of an entity. Inclusion is about how well the contributions, presence and perspectives of different groups of people are valued and integrated into an environment. </p>
            <h4>Importance of Diversity and Inclusion in the workplace</h4>
            <p>Employers use diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) initiatives for both compliance obligations and to increase the overall bottom line with a more diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce.</p>
            <p>A substantial diversity and inclusion strategy can help organizations attain top talent, driving innovative outcomes. Aside from being simply the right thing to do, savvy executives understand the many benefits of a diverse workplace and know that it’s part of improving the employee experience.</p>
            <p>A diverse workforce, in terms of age, race, religion, nationality, sexual orientations, gender, gender identity, and national origin brings diverse viewpoints and perspectives to the company.  </p>
            <p>A diverse workforce, however, is just the first step as diversity in the workplace does not necessarily mean inclusivity in the workplace. While making diversity a priority is important; Inclusivity is the key to maintaining (not just creating) workplace diversity.</p>
            <p>Inclusion in the workplace is one of the most important keys to retention. Having an inclusive workplace culture will not only help you attract a diverse set of talent but also help you retain the diverse talent you attracted in the first place.</p>
            <p>For example, consider the employee who’s a native French speaker but doesn’t feel entirely comfortable speaking any language other than French in workplace common areas. Or the breastfeeding mother just returning to work who has no space to pump her breast milk. Or the Muslim employee who feels insecure about maintaining his daily prayer routine on company grounds.  </p>
            <h4>How to Enhance Diversity and Inclusion in the workplace</h4>
            <p>First, it is important to acknowledge the differences that may exist in your departments and units, you can more consciously introduce inclusion efforts and diversity initiatives in your department. </p>
            <p>Accordingly, it is also essential to have a diverse top management team. This includes gender diversity, ethnic diversity, sexual orientation, and more. Are men and women equally represented? What about people from various cultural and religious backgrounds? These are major questions that must be answered</p>
            <p>A survey report from Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found among the Fortune 500 companies, only 24 CEOs are women, which represents just 5% of the total number of CEOs.</p>
            <p>Most often many employees quit jobs when they feel a sense of belonging to the company and its people. Employees need to feel free to express themselves based on their unique perspectives. Companies must make sure employees feel included and respected regardless of their age, gender or religion.</p>        
            <p>In conclusion, it is important to note that Diversity and inclusion (D&I) is more than policies, programs, or headcounts. Equitable employers outpace their competitors by respecting the unique needs, perspectives and potential of all their team members. As a result, diverse and inclusive workplaces earn deeper trust and more commitment from their employees.</p>
