            <h3>HOW TO INCREASE EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY</h3> 
        </div>
        <div style="line-height:20px">
            <p> </p>
            <p>Increasing productivity in the workplace is very beneficial to organisations this is facilitated by increasing the level of productivity among employees which is not the easiest task to execute. </p>
            <p>Measuring productivity differs depending on organisation’s objectives, this could range from meeting deadlines, increasing sales or higher rate of customer satisfaction. However, productivity is not measured by the amount of hours put into work, a better measurement metric is the work employees put into their hours.</p>
            <p>High productivity at the workplace is a sign of healthy work culture. Hence, productivity will likely increase when your employees feel happy, supported and have the right tools to perform the tasks assigned to them.</p>
            <p>This points to the fact that the more productive a company is, the easier it is to establish organizational growth and create a healthy work environment. </p>
            <p>Making small changes to habits will drastically improve the levels of productivity and efficiency in an organisation. </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top:30px">How to Increase Employee productivity</h4>
            <ol style="margin-top:20px">
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Invest in Training and Development</p>
                    <p>It is important for organisations to ensure that employees grow and develop as they work for you. 
                        Not only is it beneficial for them, but it will be for the company as well. Up-skilling your employees will not only widen their skillset, but it can spur them to do a better job. In order to compete with the best and succeed, you have to keep up with trends and changing methods. 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Avoid Micromanaging</p>
                    <p>In an employee’s eyes, there is nothing worse than an employer that micromanages. Not only does micromanaging demonstrate to your employees that you’re a little bit controlling, but it can also indicate that don’t trust them enough to do a good job on their own. And if there’s a lack of trust, then how can you expect your employees to be motivated to work productively?
                        Once you allocate a task or project, set your expectations, offer some instructions, then let your employees be. Always be available if they need to ask questions, but let them take control of their own work.
                        </p>
                    <p>By not monitoring their every move and telling them what and how to do things, you’re allowing your employees to learn and to make decisions for themselves.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Authorize Flexible Work</p>
                    <p>Implementing a flexible workforce can become an added perk that motivates employees to work more productively. Having this flexibility is not only attractive to those who want to work at home, but also for parents and employees who have other commitments that may run at the same time as regular work hours.</p>
                    <p>It establishes trust and gives them a sense of independence. It also opens up a new way of working which could possibly see a more productive result for some workers.</p>
                    <p>A great way to promote health and wellbeing is to make sure your employees actually take their lunch breaks and to do so away from their desks. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">4. Mitigate Distractions</p>
                    <p>Everyone gets distracted sometimes — that’s human nature. But if distractions are seriously impacting productivity in your workplace, that’s a problem. It is a major factor that affects the productivity of employees</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">5. Recognize and reward your employees</p>
                    <p>Recognizing employees when they do an excellent job can boost work morale and make them want to work even harder. Motivating and rewarding your team can cultivate a sense of fulfillment and inspire others to be more productive.  </p>
                    <p>There are many perks to increasing productivity in the workplace. It can drive profits, reduce operational costs, maximize resources, and improve customer service. Other notable things it can bring are a boost in employee engagement and an overall happy and healthy work environment.</p>
