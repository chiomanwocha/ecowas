            <h3>TEAM BUILDING STRATEGIES </h3> 
        </div>
        <div style="line-height:20px">
            <p> </p>
            <p>Team building refers to the activities undertaken by groups of people in order to increase their motivation, boost cooperation and increase their overall performance. With a strong team, organizations are more likely to actualize their objectives. Many multinational organizations spend considerable amounts of money on team building strategies such as indoor training and outdoor experiential training where the team members are encouraged to bond with each other professionally as well as personally.</p>
            <h4 style="margin-top:30px">Strategies for Team Building</h4>
            <ol style="margin-top:20px">
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Hold regular corporate retreats</p>
                    <p>Work with no play makes employees dull, unmotivated, and socially distant. It increases burnout and causes employees to leave their jobs prematurely. Everything doesn’t have to be solely centered on deadlines, output, productivity, and profits. The physical and mental well-being of the team members is also important. It is important to takes breaks, to have fun and leave office worries behind. You can participate in group games, sporting events, philanthropic endeavors, community development activities, and anything that can be done by a group of friends. This will facilitate interoffice relationships, builds trust and understanding, and builds a family out of what would ordinarily be a bunch of colleagues.</p>
                    <p>Team building is much easier and less stressful when people have fun and are not under stress.      </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Nurture leaders, not workers</p>
                    <p>Leaders are motivated, focused, and committed to every project they handle. They don’t just report to work because they need a paycheck at the end of each month. They come to work with goals in their mind; wanting to make a difference in their projects, departments, organization, industry, and the world as a whole. They aren’t just “the boss” by title, but they know how to lead and to take charge of every project they are in. Leaders are facilitators too. They are always ready to share their expertise for the benefit of other team members. They understand that as much as they could have a better scope or comprehension of a task at hand, their solution might not always be the only way. That helps them gather and accommodate varied opinions even when they have their reservations. Leaders aren’t hired. They are nurtured. Focus on nurturing young recruits so that they can become leaders in their small capacity</p>

                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">3.	Encourage collaboration and not just communication</p>
                    <p>Frequent communication is a necessity in any team. It is the tool that helps team members share ideas, overcome obstacles, pass instructions amongst themselves, and resolve conflicts. It also enhances collaboration. Successful teams excel in collaboration. This means sharing knowledge and the freedom to ask questions and give answers without fear. It is important to ensure that employees have regular in-person meetings and brainstorming sessions. Create an agenda for each meeting and make sure the meeting stays focused on the topic on hand.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">4.	Help members understand their role and mission</p>
                    <p>Members of your team applied for the job because they had general ideas of what their roles entail but the general is never enough. It takes different types of personalities to make a team run effectively. Some people are better communicators, some have brighter ideas and some are more efficient and organized. By defining responsibilities beyond specific tasks and thinking about team roles holistically, a team can maximize the talents of the individual members while forming a single entity with the power to achieve great things. You need to give each member an in-depth understanding of the company vision, team goals, and the role they play in realizing the vision. When everyone knows what they are expected to do, you prevent duplicity of roles and create a cohesive team in which everyone respects each other’s contributions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">5.	Develop strong conflict resolution mechanisms</p>
                    <p>It is wishful thinking to assume that all workers will work in harmony despite their diverse cultural and professional backgrounds, different ambitions, generational gaps, contrasting personalities, as well as religious and gender preferences. That is why you need to work with the human resources department in resolving personal issues as they arise. Create an avenue through which employees can air out grievances and sort out their differences without fear of persecution. Conflict can get a bad rap, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing. Conflict is often the means by which strategies are developed and ideas perfected. The best teams respect each other, working through their disagreements rather than letting their differences divide them. If managed well, conflict can be a fire that refines rather than destroys.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">6.	Give and Accept Feedback</p>
                    <p>Providing feedback in a way that supports the individual’s growth and development, can be a wonderful tool for identifying potential blind spots and increasing self-awareness through others’ perceptions. In a way, team members are coaching and developing each other, and obstacles to team success are being addressed in a respectful, constructive manner that focuses on professional growth rather than on personal criticism.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">7.	Establish Trust</p>
                    <p>The foundation of any lasting relationship, professional or personal, is trust. In a professional setting, team members have to know others will deliver on promises, support shared goals, pitch in during challenging times and maintain open communication. If you put your trust in team members, and they return that trust, the team bond is strengthened. </p>
                    <p>In conclusion, teamwork is a prerequisite for greater creativity, productivity, and effectiveness. It is a platform where individual talents collaborate to produce exceptionally high-quality final products. Team building is as much about friendships and relationships as it is about professionalism, and hence, the focus of team building must also be on the development and the nurturing of relationships and personal friendships between the team members. Organizations must follow the examples of the Armed Forces in fostering a spirit of camaraderie and cohesion within the team as well as use formal and informal methods of team building using experiential training.</p>
