            <h3>FIND MOTIVATION</h3> 
        </div>
        <div style="line-height:20px">
            <p> </p>
            <p>As time passes, it is possible to no longer have the same energy, the same desire
                to get to work, to do the work we are paid to do, productivity
                sometimes fails.</p>
            <p>The loss of motivation is a delicate problem both for the employee, but also for
                the organization in which he operates. In this sense, developing motivation is an integral part of
                human resource management, and is one of the central tasks of executives and managers.
                To overcome this problem it would be necessary to know the sources of demotivation in the employee and
                then how to solve this problem.</p>
            <h4>The causes of demotivation at work</h4>
            <ol style="margin-top:20px">
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. The feeling of belonging</p>
                    <p>The image that the employee has of the organization has an influence
                        enormously on his degree of involvement, commitment and especially on his motivation in the organization. In
                        an employee with a poor representation of the organization will necessarily provide less
                        effort in carrying out daily tasks. For the organization, managing to create a
                        pride of belonging to the organization would be the first thing to do in the search for
                        staff motivation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">2. The lack of recognition</p>
                    <p>In the organization, recognition is not only linked to
                        work results. The staff member in the performance of his duties expects premium on board
                        to an existential recognition which recognizes him as a member of the organization having a
                        unique expertise. Next, recognition linked to work practice, which amounts to highlighting the
                        practices and professional skills of staff members. Finally, the recognition linked to
                        the investment is about recognizing and thanking the efforts of each staff member.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">3. Lack of promotion:</p>
                    <p>For an employee to know that he has the possibility of evolving and climbing
                        levels in the organization in which he evolves remains, among other things, one of the sources of motivation. AT
                        on the other hand, working in an environment without the possibility of evolution is to find oneself in a
                        organization or the employees make no effort in accomplishing their task but
                        also for the collective purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>The causes of demotivation are both related to the functioning of the organization in general, but
                        also, could be related to a personal character of the member of the organization. Return his work
                        “meaningful” for the individual who performs it constitutes a powerful source of motivation, but there is
                        has many ways to do this, ways whose effectiveness depends as much on individuals as on the
                        content and working environment.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Finding or rediscovering motivation</h4>
            <ol style="margin-top:20px">
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">1. Acquire new skills </p>
                <p>Functions within the organization evolve, the more time
                    happens, professions evolve, forcing staff to train and be able to do their job
                    with enthusiasm.
                    Think about when you last learned new skills related or unrelated to your job.
                    times.</p>
                <li>
                    <p style="font-weight: bold;">2. Build your career plan</p>
                    <p>To give oneself the desire to work to surpass oneself necessarily passes to define
                        a career plan that allows you to boost your skills. The career plan should be a
                        professional objective for any member of staff it would always be good to know their objectives
                        short and long term to better orient themselves professionally. It would be nice to discuss it with
                        his superior so that together we can find the best way to get there.</p>
                    <p>Motivation remains a daily task and requires very good organization and good
                        attitude. Defining a goal, as difficult as it is, should allow us to raise our level of
                        competence and motivate us.
