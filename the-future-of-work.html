            <h3>THE FUTURE OF WORK, THE NEW NORMAL </h3> 
        </div>
        <div style="line-height:20px">
            <p> </p>
            <p>The world of work as we know it has been profoundly affected by the global pandemic. Before COVID-19 the prime disruptions to work were new technologies and growing trade links. However, the importance of the physical dimension of work has been elevated as the pandemic unsettled the global labor markets during 2020, sending the world into lockdown just months after it was initially detected.  The short-term effects of the pandemic were often severe and sudden with millions of people losing their jobs and others adjusting to remote working as offices closed. During this unprecedented time, organizations have managed to utilization the pandemic as an opportunity for change with organizations and their employees adopting new skills and developing new behaviors which have improved the way they operate. </p>
            <p>For decades, it was believed that the usually 9 to 5, office centric work was most effective but as organizations are driven to embrace the changes brought about by the pandemic, such as employees working from home, a change in productivity and employee engagement has been observed. The shift in working life has pushed organizations to only keep the most effective parts of office culture and disregard inefficient processes, with a more supportive culture centered on getting the best from their employees as well as improving their lives. A great example of this is Hisense Mexico whose top priorities is to keep their employees safe at home by keeping them motivated, engaged and informed by holding regular virtual meetings, sending newsletters and virtual events. Hisense intends to keep the new culture it has created post-pandemic.</p>
            <p>Another impact that COVID-19 has had on the workplace is hybrid/flexible working environment. Many organizations are moving towards a hybrid working environment where employees can work both remotely and in the office. Workplaces are becoming more distributed across homes and offices allowing employees the freedom to choose how they work. This in turn has brought about remote communication, where cloud storage is utilized for data and security measures for various modes of working as well as other forms of technology. This has also forced employees to develop new skills that are more technology oriented. Leading organizations into a new era of employees who are more versed in technical knowledge.</p>
            <p>The pandemic has compelled employers to ask what hard skills employees possess and how are they useful to the organization? It is true that inherently human abilities are incredibly important and will continue to be however, they will have to be mixed with some basic technical knowledge in order for an employee to thrive post-pandemic. As the world and workplace rely more on digital assets, digital skills—including programming, design, writing and coding—will be even more vital to succeed. It is important for an employee to be open to using digital communication platforms at work and know when to use certain platforms.</p>
            <p>Cyber security has also become quite high in demand, with cybercriminal becoming more sophisticated and more individuals working from home, often using their internet connected devices, there are more targets than ever before. For organizations, this presents a huge issue. If an organization’s data gets breach, confidential information could be leaked, spelling trouble for any organization. It would be highly beneficial for any employee who is considering learning a new skill to invest in a cybersecurity course or certification. Any employee with this skill will surely be highly soughed after in the new job market.</p>
            <p>As workplace conditions today continue to change rapidly, organizations are now in search of employees who can adapt quickly. Just as an organization may have quickly adapted to new ways of working and communicating, the willingness and capability to adapt will rise to the top of desired employee skills. Therefore, employees are encouraged to maintain a flexible mindset which is always looking to improve.</p>
            <p>In the business world, employees are expected to interact with each other, making emotional intelligence a fundamental skill for all. It is the capacity to differentiate, evaluate and respond while recognizing both one’s emotions and the emotions of others. Emotional intelligence is often a desirable skill for leadership roles, but it is relevant in today’s workplace for all roles. Studies show that employees with higher Emotional intelligence typically navigate the workplace more effectively and are more resilient. This is attributable to their possession of empathy, motivation, self-awareness, self-regulation and social skills. For the most part, human nature does not change and understanding human nature is essential in this time and age. An employee with emotional intelligence is an employee with an evergreen skill.</p>
            <p>The new world after coronavirus will never be precisely the same. Old ideas and approaches to the business world simply do not cut it anymore. If you want to put yourself in a position to acquire and keep the best job possible in your dream organization, follow the guide above. Learn one of the skills that will make you stand out from the rest and give you an edge in the new work order.</p>
