            <h3>DEFINITION OF A HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT </h3> 
        </div>
        <div style="line-height:20px">
            <p> </p>
            <p>Spending bad days at work, every employee has endured it once. A boring job, disagreements with colleagues, a difficult superior, a lack of recognition however, would all these criteria be appropriate to qualify an environment as hostile?</p>
            <p>Although these aforementioned elements could be part of it, the work environment becomes hostile from the moment when the aforementioned elements remain in the daily habit of the organization, thus creating confinement, the absence of communication and a fairly visible discomfort. by all members of the organization.</p>
            <p>More clearly, a hostile environment could be defined as the behaviors and habits of management or employees that partially or totally prevent another member of staff from performing their daily tasks.</p>
            <h4>How to recognize a hostile work environment</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><p>1. Discriminatory actions, behaviors, remarks.</p></li>
                <li><p>2. Clan behaviors and attitudes.</p></li>
                <li><p>3. The exclusion or isolation of a person.</p></li>
                <li><p>4. Bullying in the workplace through hurtful, humiliating, degrading remarks.</p></li>
                <li><p>5. Birth of a feeling of incompetence when responsibilities are not entrusted and or removed without reason.</p></li>
                <li><p>6. The focus is more on production and results than on the well-being of staff members.</p></li>
                <li><p>7. Employees who no longer care about work.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The list is not exhaustive in the sense that each staff member personally encounters or experiences situations which unfortunately would contribute to making their work environment hostile. It is good to remember that a hostile environment impacts the motivation, the performance and the individual but also collective well-being of the members of the personnel and the organization.</p>
